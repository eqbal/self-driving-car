# You'll be classifying the handwritten numbers 0, 1, and 2 from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The above is a small sample of the data you'll be training on. Notice how some of the 1s are written with a serif at the top and at different angles. The similarities and differences will play a part in shaping the weights of the model.
